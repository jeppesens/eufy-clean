# Eufy-Clean
## Overview
This Eufy Clean repo provides an interface to interact with Eufy cleaning devices. It includes functionalities to login, pair new devices, and manage cleaning operations through cloud and MQTT connections.
It is originally based on [eufy-clean](https://github.com/martijnpoppen/eufy-clean) by [martijnpoppen](https://github.com/martijnpoppen) but has been rewritten to use Python and adding support for Home Assistant.

## FAQ
- This repo only has support for MQTT enabled Eufy Vacuums, which means you need to have a device that supports MQTT. E.g the Robovac X10 Pro Omni.
- This code was ported and tested on a Robovac X10 Pro Omni, but it should work on other models as well ü§ûüèº
- This code is written by me for me, feel free to use it and open issues, and PRs. I will try to help as much as I can, but I can't guarantee anything.

## Usage

### Example
If you want to use this code without using Home Assistant, you can use the `EufyClean` class directly. Here's a simple example of how to use it:

```py
import asyncio
import os

from custom_components.robovac_mqtt.EufyClean import EufyClean


async def setup():
    eufy_clean = EufyClean(os.getenv('EUFY_USERNAME'), os.getenv('EUFY_PASSWORD'))
    await eufy_clean.init()
    devices = await eufy_clean.get_devices()
    print(devices)

    device_id = next((d['deviceId'] for d in devices if d), None)
    if not device_id:
        return
    device = await eufy_clean.init_device(device_id)
    await device.connect()
    print(device)
    status = await device.get_work_status()
    print(status)
    battery_level = await device.get_battery_level()
    print(battery_level)
    await device.go_home()
    # await device.set_clean_param({'clean_type': 'SWEEP_ONLY'})
    """
    // full home daily clean: 1
    home: 1,
    // full home deep clean: 2
    // Post-Meal Clean: 3
    morning: 4,
    afternoon: 5,
    weekly: 6,
    """
    await device.scene_clean(4)
    # await device.play()
    # await device.go_home()
    status = await device.get_work_status()
    mode = await device.get_work_mode()
    print(status, mode)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    import dotenv
    dotenv.load_dotenv()
    asyncio.run(setup())
```

### Home Assistant
If you want to use this code with Home Assistant, you should be able to install it with HACS by adding this repo
